# olc_pixel_game_engine_game
This is my attempt at creating a game using the olc::pixel game engine. The aim is to make a simple retro style game that can be run on the raspberry pi zero. I dont even know if it is possible or if the rpi zero has the graphics capability to run even a simple platformer type game.

After some testing it would seem the absolute most fps i can get out of the RPI zero is around 25-30. At this point it might be barley possible to create a half decent game. Lets see how it goes.
